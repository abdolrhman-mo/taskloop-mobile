## Todo
1- Animated Arrow
ðŸ‘€ What:
Add a pulsing down arrow or chevron icon at the bottom â†’ visual nudge.

### ðŸ“Œ When to SHOW the arrow
ðŸ‘‰ The arrow should appear only when thereâ€™s more content to scroll.
Example:
- If the list is scrollable (not fully visible), show the arrow.
- If the list is fully visible (fits on screen), hide the arrow â€” no need for a hint.

### ðŸ“Œ When to HIDE the arrow
ðŸ‘‰ When the user reaches the end â†’ they donâ€™t need a hint anymore.
Example:
- If you scroll to the bottom â†’ hide the arrow.
- Or if your data is short â†’ hide it immediately.
